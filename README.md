# GraphTheory-2017-Project
3rd Year Under-graduate graph theory project using Neo4J

## Summary
In this project I am going to use Neo4J to create a timetable based off information made available from GMIT.
I hope to build a scalable robust graph based database to represent the timetable information.

The Nodes in which this graph db is broken up into are as follows:
|Name | Type | Relationship|
|------|------|------|
|Day | Node |?|
|Timeslot | Node |?|
|Room | Node |?|
|Module| Node|?|
|Group | Node|?|
|Course | Node|?|
|Lecturer| Node|?|

More information will follow.
